            the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under
            applicable law.</p>

            case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
            laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
            State of New York or any other jurisdiction).</p>
            
            <p>Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms or the Site shall be instituted
            exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of New York, in each case located in
            the County of Kings County, although we retain the right to bring any suit, action or proceeding against you for breach
            of these Terms in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the
            exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.</p>

            <h2 class="pt-4">Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>If you have any issue or dispute with the Company, you agree to first contact us at hello@lilosocial.com and attempt to
            resolve the dispute with us informally. If we are not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, both parties
            agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising
            out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association
            (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect
            for the AAA, except as provided herein.</p>
            
            <p>Unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in Orange County. Each party will be responsible
            for paying their respective AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. The award
            rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for
            expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
            competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable
            relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the
            Service.</p>
            
            <p>ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
            CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE
            PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL
            BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

            <h2 class="pt-4">Severability and Waiver</h2>

            <h2 class="pt-4">Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted
            to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining
            provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>

            <h2 class="pt-4">Waiver</h2>
            <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under these Terms
            shall not effect a party’s ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall
            the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
